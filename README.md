# Path-Visualiser

This is a web based application that visualises different graph traversal algorithms. 
The application allows the selection of algorithms, including breadth and depth first search, A*, Dijkstra's, greedy best first and lowest cost first.
Random mazes can be generated, as well as walls placed on the grid for the algorithm to avoid.
Topographies can also be generated, which assign different costs to squares on the grid, so that algorithms such as Dijkstra or lowest cost first have to find the cheapest option.
